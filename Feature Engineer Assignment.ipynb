    "# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is important before fitting a machine learning model because:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Understand the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "# EDA helps you understand the dataset, including the distribution of data, relationships between variables, and potential patterns. Without this, you may miss important insights or errors in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Handle Missing Values:\n",

    "# Some models assume specific distributions (e.g., linear regression assumes normality). EDA helps check if this assumption holds or if transformations are needed.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 6. Understand Relationships:\n",
